Picking any topic of your choice, you will generate a database using the SQLite software.

The database will contain at least 7 columns, where at least one column has nominal data, at least one has ordinal data, at least one has interval data and at least one has ratio data. At least one table should have 1000 rows or more and utilisation of foreign and compound keys across multiple tables. The more realistic a database, the better.


1. How you generated the data (do not download other people's data).
2. The schema of your database (graphical or textual is fine).
3. Your justification for any separate tables (including any constraints on any attributes) and an ethical/data privacy discussion.
